## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please if you find any vulnerability raise an issue and add it to the one and only project.
I check the - project - board most of the time where I can sort the issues that I have, and
if you don't add your issue to the project I will probably wont see it for an unknown time.

Any suggestion and notice is very welcomed but since it is a garage/hobby project that I 
make in my spare time, please accept that the resolution of your issue may have an uncertain
amount of delay until it gets to the latest released version.

Thanks!
